# Installation 

1. Download `vlcsay_vx.x.x.zip` zip archive of VLCSay in Assets in the [Releases](https://github.com/turbosmurfen/VLCSay/releases/latest) section.
2. If you don't have `Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x86)` installed, download from here: [https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe).  
3. Right Click on the archive which is named _vlcsay_vx.x.x.zip_, extract the archive.  
   * Optional - verify the hash: 
       1. Open up powershell and **cd** to **vlcsay_vx.x.x** folder. 
       2. Run this command `Get-FileHash vlcsay.dll`. 
       3. Then look if the sha256 checksum is correct from [Releases](https://github.com/turbosmurfen/VLCSay/releases/latest). 
       4. If it's correct you should be fine. 
4. Open mIRC.
5. Paste `//noop $sfile($mircdir)` to mIRC and press enter. You will see a file picker dialog.
6. Copy `vlcsay.dll` and paste inside this popup window. **OR** save it where you have your other DLL files.
